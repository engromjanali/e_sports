[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

# Supabase Database Documentation

This project uses [Supabase](https://supabase.com) as its backend — PostgreSQL database, Auth, and Storage.
Both the **Admin** (Flutter web/desktop) and **User** (Flutter mobile) apps connect to the **same Supabase project**.

---

## Project Overview

An e-sports club management platform for tracking players, matches, seasons, stats, news, and hall of fame entries.

- **Admin app** — manages players, matches, entries, news, FAQs, settings
- **User app** — read-only view: standings, match results, news, hall of fame, player profiles

---

## Setup: Recreate the Database

### Step 1 — Create a Supabase Project

1. Go to [https://supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and create a new project
2. Note your **Project URL** and **anon public key** from `Project Settings → API`

### Step 2 — Run Schema SQL

Open **SQL Editor → New Query** in your Supabase dashboard and run the following in order:

```sql
-- Enable UUID extension
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp";

-- 1. No foreign key dependencies
CREATE TABLE public.season (
  id bigint GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY NOT NULL,
  name text,
  start_date timestamp with time zone NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  end_date timestamp with time zone,
  is_current boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT false,
  CONSTRAINT season_pkey PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

CREATE TABLE public.players (
  id uuid NOT NULL DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  name text NOT NULL,
  sort_name text,
  profileimageurl text,
  jerseynumber integer,
  createdat timestamp with time zone DEFAULT now(),
  email text UNIQUE,
  CONSTRAINT players_pkey PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

CREATE TABLE public.competitions (
  id bigint GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY NOT NULL,
  name text NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  is_active boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT true,
  created_at timestamp with time zone NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  CONSTRAINT competitions_pkey PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

CREATE TABLE public.player_role (

  id bigint GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY NOT NULL,
  created_at timestamp with time zone NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),

  status boolean DEFAULT true,
  CONSTRAINT custom_tags_pkey PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

-- Junction tables: connect players to their roles and tags
CREATE TABLE public.player_player_roles (
  player_id uuid NOT NULL,
  role_id bigint NOT NULL,
  CONSTRAINT player_player_roles_pkey PRIMARY KEY (player_id, role_id),
  CONSTRAINT player_player_roles_player_id_fkey FOREIGN KEY (player_id) REFERENCES public.players(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  CONSTRAINT player_player_roles_role_id_fkey FOREIGN KEY (role_id) REFERENCES public.player_role(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

CREATE TABLE public.player_custom_tags (
  player_id uuid NOT NULL,

  CONSTRAINT player_custom_tags_pkey PRIMARY KEY (player_id, tag_id),
  CONSTRAINT player_custom_tags_player_id_fkey FOREIGN KEY (player_id) REFERENCES public.players(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  CONSTRAINT player_custom_tags_tag_id_fkey FOREIGN KEY (tag_id) REFERENCES public.custom_tags(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

CREATE TABLE public.news (

  title text NOT NULL,
  content text NOT NULL,
  author text NOT NULL,
  category text NOT NULL,
  date text NOT NULL,
  hot boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT false,
  image text,
  emoji text,
  CONSTRAINT news_pkey PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

CREATE TABLE public.faqs (
  id bigint GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY NOT NULL,
  question text NOT NULL,
  answer text NOT NULL,
  category text NOT NULL DEFAULT 'General'::text,
  display_order integer NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  is_active boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT true,
  created_at timestamp with time zone NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  CONSTRAINT faqs_pkey PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

-- 2. Depends on season + competitions
CREATE TABLE public.matches (
  id uuid NOT NULL DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  season_id bigint NOT NULL,
  hometeam text NOT NULL DEFAULT 'The Elits'::text,
  awayteam text NOT NULL DEFAULT ''::text,
  homescore integer,
  awayscore integer,
  date text NOT NULL DEFAULT ''::text,
  status text NOT NULL DEFAULT 'upcoming'::text
    CHECK (status = ANY (ARRAY['upcoming'::text, 'live'::text, 'finished'::text, 'cancelled'::text])),
  competition_id bigint,
  CONSTRAINT matches_pkey PRIMARY KEY (id),
  CONSTRAINT matches_season_id_fkey FOREIGN KEY (season_id) REFERENCES public.season(id),
  CONSTRAINT matches_competition_id_fkey FOREIGN KEY (competition_id) REFERENCES public.competitions(id)
);

-- 3. Depends on season
CREATE TABLE public.app_settings (
  id bigint GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY NOT NULL,
  current_season_id bigint,
  version text,
  verify_email boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT false,
  maintenance_mode boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT false,
  updated_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT now(),
  CONSTRAINT app_settings_pkey PRIMARY KEY (id),
  CONSTRAINT app_settings_current_season_id_fkey FOREIGN KEY (current_season_id) REFERENCES public.season(id)
);

-- 4. Depends on players + season
CREATE TABLE public.match_entries (
  id uuid NOT NULL DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  playerid uuid NOT NULL,
  matchid uuid NOT NULL,
  goals integer DEFAULT 0,
  goalsconceded integer DEFAULT 0,
  hattricks integer DEFAULT 0,
  cleansheet boolean DEFAULT false,
  motm boolean DEFAULT false,
  result text DEFAULT 'draw'::text
    CHECK (result = ANY (ARRAY['win'::text, 'loss'::text, 'draw'::text])),

  CONSTRAINT player_season_stats_season_id_fkey FOREIGN KEY (season_id) REFERENCES public.season(id)
);

-- 5. Depends on players
CREATE TABLE public.hall_of_frame (
  id bigint GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY NOT NULL,
  created_at timestamp with time zone NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  player_id uuid,
  category text,
  season_text text,
  sub_title text,
  descriptions text,
  CONSTRAINT hall_of_frame_pkey PRIMARY KEY (id),
  CONSTRAINT hall_of_frame_player_id_fkey FOREIGN KEY (player_id) REFERENCES public.players(id)
);
```

### Step 3 — Run Trigger SQL

`player_season_stats` is **auto-maintained** by a trigger — never write to it directly.
Every INSERT / UPDATE / DELETE on `match_entries` recalculates and upserts the stats automatically.

```sql
-- Required unique constraint for upsert
ALTER TABLE public.player_season_stats
ADD CONSTRAINT player_season_stats_player_season_unique
UNIQUE (player_id, season_id);

-- Trigger function
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION sync_player_season_stats()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
DECLARE
  v_player_id uuid;
  v_season_id bigint;
BEGIN
  IF TG_OP = 'DELETE' THEN
    v_player_id := OLD.playerid;
    v_season_id := OLD.season_id;
  ELSE
    v_player_id := NEW.playerid;
    v_season_id := NEW.season_id;
  END IF;

  IF v_season_id IS NULL THEN
    IF TG_OP = 'DELETE' THEN RETURN OLD; END IF;
    RETURN NEW;
  END IF;

  INSERT INTO public.player_season_stats (
    player_id, season_id, appearances, goals, cleansheets,
    hattricks, motmcount, wins, draws, losses, goalsconceded, updated_at
  )
  SELECT
    v_player_id,
    v_season_id,
    COUNT(*),
    COALESCE(SUM(goals), 0),
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cleansheet = true),
    COALESCE(SUM(hattricks), 0),
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE motm = true),
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE result = 'win'),
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE result = 'draw'),
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE result = 'loss'),
    COALESCE(SUM(goalsconceded), 0),
    now()
  FROM public.match_entries
  WHERE playerid = v_player_id AND season_id = v_season_id
  ON CONFLICT (player_id, season_id)
  DO UPDATE SET
    appearances   = EXCLUDED.appearances,
    goals         = EXCLUDED.goals,
    cleansheets   = EXCLUDED.cleansheets,
    hattricks     = EXCLUDED.hattricks,
    motmcount     = EXCLUDED.motmcount,
    wins          = EXCLUDED.wins,
    draws         = EXCLUDED.draws,
    losses        = EXCLUDED.losses,
    goalsconceded = EXCLUDED.goalsconceded,
    updated_at    = EXCLUDED.updated_at;

  IF TG_OP = 'DELETE' THEN RETURN OLD; END IF;
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

-- Attach trigger
CREATE TRIGGER trigger_sync_player_season_stats
AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE ON public.match_entries
FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION sync_player_season_stats();
```

### Step 4 — Environment Variables

Add your Supabase credentials to the project `.env` file:

```env
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-public-key
```

## Important Notes

1. **`player_season_stats` is read-only from app code** — only written by the database trigger
2. **`match_entries.matchid` has no FK** — the admin is responsible for passing a valid `matches.id`
3. **`app_settings` should always have exactly one row** — create it manually after setup
4. **Player roles and tags use junction tables** — `player_player_roles` and `player_custom_tags` link players to `player_role` and `custom_tags` via real FK constraints (cascade on delete)
5. **Match status values:** `upcoming` | `live` | `finished` | `cancelled`
6. **Match entry result values:** `win` | `loss` | `draw`
